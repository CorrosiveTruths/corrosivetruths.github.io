**Peter** has played a lot of games over the years.

He made this website due to an exasperation with traditional videogame reporting and reviewing, reiterating what they've read on Kotaku and 4chan making almost all game reporting painfully generic.

This is Peter's answer.

Born in 1981, Peter lives with his son, a cat, and a girlfriend. He has a degree in Computing and Networks.

**Michaela** is a thirty something cephalopod, or a 30 year old English chick with too much time on her hands.

She reviews video games, and likes tea, cats and cute things.

She enjoys reading, writing, drinking tea, and Â video games, particularly story driven ones, or horror.

Michaela's website is [StudiousOctopus](https://studiousoctopus.com/).
